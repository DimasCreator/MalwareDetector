        <h3>Streaming voice translation</h3>
        <p>By this date, we want to implement most of the functionality of our service - streaming speech translation.
          This will allow the user to communicate voices with people with disabilities.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="event" data-date="08.11.2021">
        <h3>Adding WebRTC support</h3>
        <p>By this date, we will test and add WebRTC technology, which will allow viewing the translation
          from all mobile devices. Now the service works only on the latest versions of Android and iOS<p>
      </li>
      <li class="event" data-date="25.10.2021">
        <h3>Mobile app prototype</h3>
        <p>On this day, we will release a prototype of a mobile application for closed alpha testing. The application
          will increase the functionality of the translator for and significantly increase the speed of translation.</p>

        <h3>MVP date. Adding a user's personal account. Adding video translation support</h3>
        <p>This date can be considered the date of creation of our product as a product. From now on, any number of
          people will be able to use it. Translation of videos into gest language is one of our main tasks. This feature
          will appear on this date. At first we will support youtube, gradually expanding support for different
          services.</p>

        <h3>Hot fix!</h3>
        <p>We changed the background to better define gestures, added smoothness to our interpreter, made it possible to
          set the interpretation speed and added highlighting of the interpreted word and spelling.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="event" data-date="13.09.2021">
        <h3>Support for different display models</h3>
        <p>Now the prototype has the ability to change the background and models and one model of the C3PO robot. In the
          future, we plan to significantly expand the list of models.</p>

      <li class="event" data-date="13.09.2021">
        <h3>Increasing the number of words and motion quality</h3>
        <p>We have increased the number of words and redesigned the mechanism for displaying them. We will continue to
          count the number of words in the system. The system now uses a spelling mechanism for unknown words. If you
          want to help us with this, write to <b>support@goge.tech</b>.</p>

        <h3>Launching a prototype</h3>
        <p>We're here now. We did a huge part of the work - we tested different ideas and chose the best ones to
          implement.<p>
